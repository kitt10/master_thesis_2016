neural networks from the beginning, network types, principles its usage for classification

4-5 pages

Classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, has a broad array of applications. To fit a classifier to a problem, one needs to define a problem data structure. Data consists of samples and discrete targets, often called classes. The samples are sooner or later converted into so called feature vectors of a fixed length. The length of feature vectors usually determines an input of a chosen classifier and the number of classes sets an output.
