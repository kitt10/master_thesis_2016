\chapter{Introduction} \label{chapter:01:introduction}

The thesis must clearly state its theme, hypotheses and/or goals (sometimes called “the research question(s)”), and provide sufficient background information to enable a non-specialist researcher to understand them. It must contain a thorough review of relevant literature, perhaps in a separate chapter.

\section{Master Thesis Objectives} \label{sec:goals}

""" just saved this text here, will be reformulated.... """
Plenty of neural network implementations are available nowadays. Nevertheless, one of the objectives of this thesis is to implement own framework capable of using the idea behind artificial feedforward neural networks. Besides prooving a knowledge of mathematical and algorithmical backgrounds, an integration of own utilities and functions is the main reason for the from-scratch implementation.
