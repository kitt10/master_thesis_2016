\chapter{Neural Network Implementation}
\label{chapter:04:neural_net_implementation}

The account of the research should be presented in a manner suitable for the field. It should be complete, systematic, and sufficiently detailed to enable a reader to understand how the data were gathered and how to apply similar methods in another study. Notation and formatting must be consistent throughout the thesis, including units of measure, abbreviations, and the numbering scheme for tables, figures, footnotes, and citations. One or more chapters may consist of material published (or submitted for publication) elsewhere. See “Including Published Material in a Thesis or Dissertation” for details.
