I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Dr.~\mbox{Tomas}~\mbox{Kulvicius} for the continuous support of my work, for his valuable comments and \mbox{supervision} of my master thesis.

Next, I would like to thank my second supervisor Dr.~\mbox{Poramate}~\mbox{Manoonpong} for helping me get started with the simulation and for a great introduction to neural networks during his courses at University of Southern Denmark.

Finally, I would like to thank people from the Research Network for Self-Organization of Robot Behavior in Leipzig for providing the LpzRobots \mbox{simulator}, which was used for data collection.
