I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Dr. Tomas Kulvicius for the continuous support of my master thesis, for his valuable comments and guiding my work.

Next, I would like to thank my second supervisor Dr. Poramate Manoonpong for helping me get started with the simulation and for a great introduction to neural networks during his courses at University of Southern Denmark.

Finally, I would like to thank people from the Research Network for Self-Organization of Robot Behavior in Leipzig for providing the LpzRobots simulator, which was used for data collection.
