Proprioception and tactile sensing in insect-like legged robots is fast, illumination insensitive and biologically inspired way of ground perception. In this thesis, 14 virtually generated terrain types are classified based on the mentioned sensor system for a simulated version of hexapod robot AMOS~II. A feedforward neural network framework equipped with a novel network pruning algorithm has been developed for classification. We observe over $ 92\% $ classification accuracy on deterministic terrain data and $ 72\% $ on manually noised data. The pruning algorithm removes unimportant synapses (generally more than $ 90\% $) from a fully-connected network, while the classification accuracy does not drop significantly. The number of input neurons is reduced by $ 65\% $, resulting in the minimal network structure for the classification problem. A theory of using minimal structures for feature selection is proposed. The thesis outcome consists of a minimal neural network capable of terrain classification based on selected features of proprioceptive and tactile sensory signals.
