	Abstract = {Legged robots need to be able to classify and recognize different terrains to adapt their gait accordingly. Recent works in terrain classification use different types of sensors (like stereovision, 3D laser range, and tactile sensors) and their combination. However, such sensor systems require more computing power, produce extra load to legged robots, and/or might be difficult to install on a small size legged robot. In this work, we present an online terrain classification system. It uses only a monocular camera with a feature-based terrain classification algorithm which is robust to changes in illumination and view points. For this algorithm, we extract local features of terrains using either Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or Speed Up Robust Feature (SURF). We encode the features using the Bag of Words (BoW) technique, and then classify the words using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel. We compare this feature-based approach with a color-based approach on the Caltech-256 benchmark as well as eight different terrain image sets (grass, gravel, pavement, sand, asphalt, floor, mud, and fine gravel). For terrain images, we observe up to 90% accuracy with the feature-based approach. Finally, this online terrain classification system is successfully applied to our small hexapod robot AMOS II. The output of the system providing terrain information is used as an input to its neural locomotion control to trigger an energy-efficient gait while traversing different terrains.},

@article{article:02:laser,
    Abstract = {This paper utilizes a 2D laser range finder (LRF) to determine the behavior of a
walking robot. The LRF provides information for 1) obstacle/gap detection as
well as 2) terrain classification. The obstacle/gap detection is based on an edge
detection with increased robustness and accuracy due to customized pre and
post processing. Its output is used to drive obstacle/gap avoidance behavior or
climbing behavior, depending on the height of obstacles or the depth of gaps.
The terrain classification employs terrain roughness to select a proper gait with
respect to the current terrain. As a result, the combination of these methods
enables the robot to decide if obstacles and gaps can be climbed up/down or
have to be avoided while at the same time a terrain specific gait can be chosen.},

@article{article:03:motorsignals,
	Abstract = {The neuromechanical control principles of animal locomotion provide good insights for the development
of bio-inspired legged robots for walking on challenging surfaces. Based on such principles, we devel-
oped a neuromechanical controller consisting of a modular neural network (MNN) and of virtual agonist–
antagonist muscle mechanisms (VAAMs). The controller allows for variable compliant leg motions of
a hexapod robot, thereby leading to energy-efficient walking on different surfaces. Without any pas-
sive mechanisms or torque and position feedback at each joint, the variable compliant leg motions are
achieved by only changing the stiffness parameters of the VAAMs. In addition, six surfaces can be also
classified by observing the motor signals generated by the controller. The performance of the controller is
tested on a physical hexapod robot. Experimental results show that it can effectively walk on six different
surfaces with the specific resistances between 9.1 and 25.0, and also classify them with high accuracy.},

@article{article:04:onlinelearning,
	Abstract = {Safe teleoperation during critical missions, such as urban search and rescue, and bomb disposal, requires careful velocity control when different types of terrain are found in the scenario. This can particularly be challenging when mission time is limited and the operator's field of view affected. This paper presents a method for online adapting robot velocities according to the terrain classification results combined from vision- and laser-based classifiers. The vision-based classifier is self-supervised and adapts itself according to the vibration sensing and the pose estimation of the robot. The image patches where the vibration data are gathered are used to train the vision-based classifier. The Support Vector Machine is used for the laser-based classifier to train and classify the data. The final prediction result is produced by using the Naive Bayes Classifier to fuse the vision- and laser-based classifiers. The system is robust to illumination variations, and can be improved online given feedback from the operator.},

Haptic feedback, expressed through joint motor currents and ground contact force measurements that arises when prescribing a predefined motion was collected for a variety of ground samples (four different shapes and four different surface properties). Features were extracted from this data and used for training and classification by a multiclass AdaBoost machine learning algorithm. In a single leg testbed, the algorithm could correctly classify about 94% of the terrain shapes, and about 73% of the surface samples.},

@article{article:08:rhex,
	Abstract = {Terrain identification is a key enabling ability for generating terrain adaptive behaviors that assist both robot planning and motor control. This paper considers running legged robots from the RHex family, which the military plans to use in the field to assist troops in reconnaissance tasks. Important terrain adaptive behaviors include the selection of gaits, modulation of leg stiffness, and alteration of steering control laws that minimize slippage, maximize speed and/or reduce energy consumption. These terrain adaptive behaviors can be enabled by a terrain identification methodology that combines proprioceptive sensors already available in RHex-type robots. The proposed classification approach is based on the characteristic frequency signatures of data from leg observers, which combine current sensing with a dynamic model of the leg motion. The paper analyzes the classification accuracy obtained using both a single leg and groups of legs (through a voting scheme) on different terrains such as vinyl, asphalt, grass, and pebbles. Additionally, it presents a terrain classifier that works across various gait speeds and in fact almost as good as an overly specialized classifier.},

Furthermore, we present an accurate, robust, low-lag, and efficient algorithm for terrain classification that uses vibration data from the on-board inertial measurement unit and motor control data from back-EMF sensing and magnetic encoders.},

Unfortunately, it usually is not obvious what size is best; a system that is too small will not be able to learn the data while one that is just big enough may learn very slowly and be very sensitive to initial conditions and learning parameters. This paper is a survey of neural network pruning algorithms. The approach taken by the methods described here is to train a network that is larger than necessary and then remove the parts that are not needed.},
