	Abstract = {Legged robots need to be able to classify and recognize different terrains to adapt their gait accordingly. Recent works in terrain classification use different types of sensors (like stereovision, 3D laser range, and tactile sensors) and their combination. However, such sensor systems require more computing power, produce extra load to legged robots, and/or might be difficult to install on a small size legged robot. In this work, we present an online terrain classification system. It uses only a monocular camera with a feature-based terrain classification algorithm which is robust to changes in illumination and view points. For this algorithm, we extract local features of terrains using either Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or Speed Up Robust Feature (SURF). We encode the features using the Bag of Words (BoW) technique, and then classify the words using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel. We compare this feature-based approach with a color-based approach on the Caltech-256 benchmark as well as eight different terrain image sets (grass, gravel, pavement, sand, asphalt, floor, mud, and fine gravel). For terrain images, we observe up to 90% accuracy with the feature-based approach. Finally, this online terrain classification system is successfully applied to our small hexapod robot AMOS II. The output of the system providing terrain information is used as an input to its neural locomotion control to trigger an energy-efficient gait while traversing different terrains.},

	Abstract = {The neuromechanical control principles of animal locomotion provide good insights for the development
of bio-inspired legged robots for walking on challenging surfaces. Based on such principles, we devel-
oped a neuromechanical controller consisting of a modular neural network (MNN) and of virtual agonistâ€“
antagonist muscle mechanisms (VAAMs). The controller allows for variable compliant leg motions of
a hexapod robot, thereby leading to energy-efficient walking on different surfaces. Without any pas-
sive mechanisms or torque and position feedback at each joint, the variable compliant leg motions are
achieved by only changing the stiffness parameters of the VAAMs. In addition, six surfaces can be also
classified by observing the motor signals generated by the controller. The performance of the controller is
tested on a physical hexapod robot. Experimental results show that it can effectively walk on six different
surfaces with the specific resistances between 9.1 and 25.0, and also classify them with high accuracy.},
