  \field{abstract}{%
  Legged robots need to be able to classify and recognize different terrains to
  adapt their gait accordingly. Recent works in terrain classification use
  different types of sensors (like stereovision, 3D laser range, and tactile
  sensors) and their combination. However, such sensor systems require more
  computing power, produce extra load to legged robots, and/or might be
  difficult to install on a small size legged robot. In this work, we present
  an online terrain classification system. It uses only a monocular camera with
  a feature-based terrain classification algorithm which is robust to changes
  in illumination and view points. For this algorithm, we extract local
  features of terrains using either Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or
  Speed Up Robust Feature (SURF). We encode the features using the Bag of Words
  (BoW) technique, and then classify the words using Support Vector Machines
  (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel. We compare this feature-based
  approach with a color-based approach on the Caltech-256 benchmark as well as
  eight different terrain image sets (grass, gravel, pavement, sand, asphalt,
  floor, mud, and fine gravel). For terrain images, we observe up to 90%
  accuracy with the feature-based approach. Finally, this online terrain
  classification system is successfully applied to our small hexapod robot AMOS
  II. The output of the system providing terrain information is used as an
  input to its neural locomotion control to trigger an energy-efficient gait
  while traversing different terrains.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The neuromechanical control principles of animal locomotion provide good
  insights for the development of bio-inspired legged robots for walking on
  challenging surfaces. Based on such principles, we devel- oped a
  neuromechanical controller consisting of a modular neural network (MNN) and
  of virtual agonistâ€“ antagonist muscle mechanisms (VAAMs). The controller
  allows for variable compliant leg motions of a hexapod robot, thereby leading
  to energy-efficient walking on different surfaces. Without any pas- sive
  mechanisms or torque and position feedback at each joint, the variable
  compliant leg motions are achieved by only changing the stiffness parameters
  of the VAAMs. In addition, six surfaces can be also classified by observing
  the motor signals generated by the controller. The performance of the
  controller is tested on a physical hexapod robot. Experimental results show
  that it can effectively walk on six different surfaces with the specific
  resistances between 9.1 and 25.0, and also classify them with high accuracy.%
